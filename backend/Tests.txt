This integral is ludicrously complicated. If we can show the steps for this, we can likely evaluate any function.
(3x^2-2x-e^x) \times (9x^3-4x^8-14x^82)

This function is really big. The definite integral on the range [1,2] should equal about 99.27.
THERE IS A BUG IN SYMPY THAT STOPS THIS FROM BEING CORRECTLY EVALUATED.
x^9-x^{2.5556}-\frac{x}{x-3.6^{70}}
